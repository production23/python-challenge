#Election Data Analysis

##Overview
This Python script is designed to analyze election data from a CSV file named election_data.csv. The dataset contains information about the voters, including their voter ID, county, and the candidate they voted for.

The script calculates several key metrics, including the total number of votes cast, a complete list of candidates who received votes, the percentage of votes each candidate won, the total number of votes each candidate won, and finally, it determines the winner of the election based on the popular vote.

Usage
To use the script:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Place the election_data.csv file in the same directory as the Python script.
Run the script using a Python interpreter (e.g., python election_analysis.py).
The script reads the data from the CSV file, processes it, calculates the required metrics, and prints the election results to the console.

Output
The script prints the following information to the console:

Total number of votes cast
List of candidates who received votes
Percentage of votes each candidate won
Total number of votes each candidate won
Winner of the election based on popular vote
